Até 2030, reduzir pela metade o desperdício de alimentos per capita mundial, 
nos níveis de varejo e do consumidor, e reduzir as perdas de alimentos ao longo 
das cadeias de produção e abastecimento, incluindo as perdas pós-colheita.


Definição de despercídio: http://www.fao.org/platform-food-loss-waste/food-waste/definition/en/
Food waste refers to the decrease in the quantity or quality of food resulting from 
decisions and actions by retailers, food service providers and consumers.  
Food is wasted in many ways: Fresh produce that deviates from what is considered 
ptimal, for example in terms of shape, size and color, is often removed from the supply chain during sorting operations. 
Foods that are close to, at or beyond the “best-before” date are often discarded by 
retailers and consumers. Large quantities of wholesome edible food are often unused 
or left over and discarded from household kitchens and eating establishments.
Less food loss and waste would lead to more efficient land use and better water resource management with positive impacts on climate change and livelihoods.
